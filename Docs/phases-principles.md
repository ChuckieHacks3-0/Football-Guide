## Phases of Play

**Attack**

When we have possession of the ball

**Attacking Transition**

This occurs immediately after we win the ball from the opposition.  This is our best opportunity to score.
 
**Defense** 

When opposition has possession of the ball

**Defensive Transition**

This occurs immediately after we lose the ball.  This is the phase of play where we are most vulnerable to the other team scoring.  We need to be super aware of when possession is lost and take steps to get in a responsible defensive shape and get in front of the ball.  This is the only phase of play where winning the ball is preferrable to playing passively and keeping the player in front.  One player should be trying to win the ball and supporting players need to be in position if that player gets beat.

**Dead Ball**

Any restart after a whistle (re-starting play); either in attack or defense.
