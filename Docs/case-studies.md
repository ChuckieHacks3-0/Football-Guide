Think about the following and rewatch:

1. Holland defend narrow and when the ball is won back, attack with width
2. The defensive players communicate constantly with each other.
3. The defensive players are constantly checking their shoulder to see who the teammates who are defending with them and where they are.
4. How this shows the first principle of defense: **delay**.  Defenders don't attempt to win the ball until they have defensive support.
5. The defenders are disciplined and organized
